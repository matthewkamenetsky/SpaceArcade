Hi There!
This is a Space Arcade that I created using C# and MonoGame
There are four minigames in this arcade, and they're going to be kept a little secret!!
The hint is: download the code, head to the bin/Debug relative path, and then click the SpaceArcade application
Once you start the game, you will be prompted to create your account or enter an existing account.
A bigger hint is: check the info page in the application to find out!!!
I hope you enjoy!!!!
